# Archivation notice

Archiving this project. I suggest to use [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) (with [available schemes](https://github.com/wuqs-net/base16-windows-terminal)) instead of Console2.

# Base16 Console2

Supports [Console2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/console), focused on integrated usage with [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com).

See the [Base16 repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for more information.

This theme was built with [Base16 Builder Ruby](https://github.com/obahareth/base16-builder-ruby).

## Installation

Select one of the many color schemes available for [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16), look for the corresponding XML file in the colors folder and merge that with your `console.xml`.
